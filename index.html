            <p>Over the years I've always had a number of intrest and hobbies. The main ones for a while were making music, thrifting and eventually making digital art.
            I was inspired to start making art because I wanted to give my music to have a cohesive look and sound, that need to make art was accelerated once i relocated to Houston, TX.
            Houston as a whole was a great place that facilitated a enviorment that allowed me to go deeper into these hobbies and gain new ones. </p>

            <p> As an artist, I've always had an eye for asthetics in all forms. My first apartment was well decorated with cool thrifted furniture and decorations.
               Once me and my then fiance got a place in Houston in 2018, I was looking for a new way to add to our space, that new thing was a plant.
             The first plant was a pothos plant because it was a easy well known plant to care for.
               Once I hung the plant in the desired space I fell in love. No matter what area of the house I was in I always for my eyes being drawn to it.

         <p> Fast forward to 2023 and I've had about 100 plants since starting in 2018. Once the pandemic started in 2020 that kicked my hobby into hyperdrive. With the risk of catching COVID most indoor activities came to a halt so one of the ways I got outdoors was to go to a nursery.
               Before I knew it I was visiting plant stores and garden sections every week adding plant to my collection. The more I got into the hobby I started to become obsessed with it.
